### The storie
> I've been looking for a "geek" thing to display salat time and why not a raspberray pi, this litle computer can do most of things.
> Lazy as I am, the first thing i do was looking on the internet if somedoby already do that thing. I found some project but none of them fulfilled my expectations untill that i saw this [TV Screen] inside the masjid where I usually going to.
> And that's the begining...
