__So praytime-community is a simple one-page site with responsive design and mobile ready.__

### Features!
  - Show you salat times with 15Â°
  - Responsive design
  - Geolocation using Google API

### To do...
__Want to contribute? Great!__
- Choosing calculating method
- Replace the Google API by something open source
- Make it run in docker for convenience

### Tech
praytime-community uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Bootstrap]
* [JavaScript]
* [jQuery]
* [praytimes code]
* [GitHub]
And of course praytime-community itself is open source with on [GitHub]
* [praytime-community]

But geolocation is not, untill I find something to replace Google API
* [Google Maps Geolocation API]

### Installation
[praytime-community] is a simple web site, so you have to get a web server working and running, and place the code as you do with other site.
Or you can use python as web server and run [praytime-community] this way:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bakkanour/praytime-community.git
cd praytime-community
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

### Docker
Hope it will come sooner...
